## Project Overview
### Group Members: Zhiyan (Hermione) Deng, Elizabeth Hora, Vanessa Venkataraman
#### This respository showcases our group submission for our final project for the DATA-201: Python and Machine Learning course at Tufts University for the completion of the Master's program. 
#### In this project, we delved into understanding the differences between stars in various stages of their life cycles. Our models, including K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest, were employed to differentiate between Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), Main Sequence (MS) stars, and Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars.
